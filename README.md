MCP File Manager
Hey there! üëã

This is a simple MCP (Minimal Control Panel) File Manager project where you can create, edit, delete, and see files on the server right from a nice frontend UI.

What it can do?
Create new files with your own content

Edit files that you already have

Delete files you don‚Äôt need anymore

See a list of all files along with their contents on the screen

Modern, dark-themed, and clean interface that works well on any screen size

What‚Äôs inside?
Backend built with Node.js and Express.js

Frontend made with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Communication between frontend and backend happens via REST API calls using fetch()

Node.js installed on your machine

Basic knowledge of running commands on your terminal or command prompt

How to get started?

Or just start normally:

node index.js

The backend server will start running at:

Make sure your backend server is running so frontend can talk to it.
