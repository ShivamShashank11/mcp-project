## 🚀 How to get started?

### 📦 Backend Setup

1. Open terminal and go to the backend folder (or root folder if not separated):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   Install required packages:
   ```

npm install
Start the server:

For auto-reload on changes (recommended for dev):

npm run dev
Or just run normally:

node index.js
Backend will be available at:

http://localhost:5000
🌐 Frontend Setup
Go to the frontend folder if applicable

Open the index.html file in any browser

⚠️ Make sure your backend server is running, or the frontend won’t work!
